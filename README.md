# Vending Machine CLI

## Developed in Java using OOP fundamentals and implementing File I/O. This is one of the first projects that I have completed as a developer. The project was completed using paired programing.

## Basic Functionality:

The vending machine dispenses beverages, candy, chips, and gum.
Each item includes a Name and a Price.

The vending machine inventory is stocked via an input file when the vending machine
starts.

The vending machine is automatically restocked each time the application runs.
When the customer selects "(1) Display Vending Machine Items", they're presented
with a list of all items in the vending machine with its quantity remaining:

Each vending machine product has a slot identifier and a purchase price.
Each slot in the vending machine has enough room for 5 of that product.
Every product is initially stocked to the maximum amount.
A product that has run out must indicate that it is SOLD OUT.

When the customer selects "(2) Purchase", they are guided through the purchasing
process menu:

(1) Feed Money
(2) Select Product
(3) Finish Transaction

The customer's money is returned using nickels, dimes, and quarters
(using the smallest amount of coins possible).

After completing their purchase, the user is returned to the "Main" menu to
continue using the vending machine.

Each purchase is audited to prevent theft from the vending machine:

Includes unit tests demonstrating that code functionality. 

**Menus and submenus: **
1. Display items 
2. Purchase items
 1) Feed Money
 2) Select Product
 3) Finish Transaction
3. Exit
4. Sales Report
